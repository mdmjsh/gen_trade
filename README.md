# Gen Trade

Algorithmic trading strategy generation for crypto assets using a genetic algorithm.

## Background

This was a dissertation project undertaken as part of the [Software Engineering Master MSc program at the University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/programme/index.html), as such it should be considered an academic excercise only and is not recommended for actual trading! The project received a mark of 68%, which is a high merit (distinction = 70%).

## Project Aims

1. Explore if technical indicator-based trading is a viable option for algorithmic trading of Bitcoin

The research was cautiously optimistic that this object was satisfied. The strategies generated
did outperform the buy and hold strategy, and there were no clear indications that successful
strategies were constrained to favourable market conditions, (e.g. an up trend) hints at the
greater transferability of the TI-based approach over DNN methods. However, whilst the
results are suggestive of the generalisability of technical indicator-led strategies, the trading
scenarios followed in this study were artificial as they didn’t assess how much to invest on a
given trade but rather treated all entry signals as equal. In this sense the trading component
was a blunt instrument but they do serve to prove the concept that technical indicators can
not be ruled out. Finally, the alarming positivity of the results should be taken with a pinch of
salt and hints that there could be a calculation error that would require further investigation.

2. Determine if genetic algorithms offer a means to the discovery of novel trading strategies.

Whilst we have to be cautious about the suitability of TI-based strategies, the experimental
results show strong suitability for the application of genetic algorithms in this domain. We
can conclude that the GA was successful as the results showed an improvement in the fitness
function of the top strategies in every generation. Not only this but the lesser strategies also
showed signs of improvement compared to previous generations. Although 50 generations of
50 populations were run in the final genetic algorithm, this is too shallow to say with certainty
that the genetic process reached a global maximum. Running the algorithm across greater
generations would allow for a greater evolutionary process.

3. Produce a fully functioning end-to-end genetic algorithm software system for this specific context.

This goal was achieved as the final version of the code was containerised into a Docker ap-
plication and deployed and run in AWS via infrastructure as code tools. This means that
without significant uplift the service could be horizontally scaled to run on multiple machines
with greater parallelism. Additionally, the underlying Python codebase works as a stan-
dalone Python package and embeds many of the interesting implementation challenges such
as multiprocessing, modularity and extensibility.

## Usage:

0. Setup the environment.
`poetry install`
1. Download data using the Binance Downloader.
`poetry run run python binance_download.py`
2. Preprocess the data using `ta_trends` script.
`poetry run run python ta_trends.py`
3. Run the genetic algorithm
`poetry run python genetic.py  --write_local=True --generations=10 --population_size=100 --fitness_function=p`

To run on specific strategies (i.e. rerun on previously generated strategies):
`poetry run python genetic.py --generations=1 --strategies_path=best_strategy.json --output_path=130223.csv`

## Docker

`docker build -t gen-trade .`
`docker run gen-trade`

Note, the `ecr_push.sh` script can be used for pushing the docker image to ecr to start to run as an ecs service.
